# Plugins for OverlayPlugin

This is a set of plugins that will work with ACT's OverlayPlugin(https://github.com/RainbowMage/OverlayPlugin)

While OverlayPlugin offers already lots of cool features, I can NOT and do NOT want to include every feature directory in the core.

Therefore you can enhance and/or change the OverlayPlugin experience by adding plugins which add and/or change UI and UX.
Install these plugins as with the other cool plugins.

### PetEnPlugin.cs
While using FFXIV client in Japanese, Pets' name is displayed as Japanese on miniparse.
Therefore translate them from Japanese to English by this plugin.
You can specify {NameEn} on miniparse.html.

### NameMosaPlugin.cs
Player's name is translated to Mosaic Unicode by this plugin.
You can specify {NameMosa} on miniparse.html.
